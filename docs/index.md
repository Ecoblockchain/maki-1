## Welcome to Maki.

### [Resources](/resources)
Resources are the heart and soul of Maki, which exists solely to provide a
reasonable framework for automation surrounding their definition, as they apply
to your application.

### [Services](/services)
Resources are exposed by Maki in the form of Services.  A prime example of a 
Service would be the `http` service, which provides Resources to web clients in
the form of JSON or even HTML.
