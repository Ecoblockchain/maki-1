## Welcome to Maki.

### Architecture
Maki's architecture is Resource-centric.  All aspects of the datastore, its query pipeline, the business logic, and view layer are derived from the definition of the Resources your application exposes.

![Maki Architecture Overview](public/img/maki-architecture.png?raw=true)

TODO: explanation here.

### [Resources](/resources)
Resources are the heart and soul of Maki, which exists solely to provide a
reasonable framework for automation surrounding their definition, as they apply
to your application.

### [Services](/services)
Resources are exposed by Maki in the form of Services.  A prime example of a 
Service would be the `http` service, which provides Resources to web clients in
the form of JSON or even HTML.

### Default Directory Structure
Maki is meant to be understood without context or documentation, and as such the directory structure [and the code itself, for that matter] _should_ be fairly self-explanatory.  Nevertheless, here's an explicit declaration for each of the default folders and their intended use.
```bash
.
├── config          # configuration files (generally overridden by environment variables)
├── data            # data files for use in various places.
├── lib             # various classes / prototypes
├── locales         # strings for translations
├── private         # resources not exposed to the client (LESS, etc.).  This is a 1:1 map of the public folder
│   └── css         # contains the LESS files used to generate the **public** CSS files (currently, autogenerated using asset-rack)
├── public          # resources exposed to the client (images, CSS, etc)
│   ├── css         # CSS
│   ├── fonts       # Fonts (.woff, etc.)     
│   ├── img         # Images   
│   └── js          # JavaScript  
├── tests           # Tests.  Write them.
└── views           # composable elements for rendering HTML, JSON, or XML
```
