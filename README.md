Maki
==============

Maki is a framework for hand-rolling web applications in a way that makes sense.

- **REST API built-in.**  All URIs are semantic and indempotent, automatically.
- **Client-Responsiveness.**  Don't rely on user-agents or referers, but instead respond to what the client supports.  Make a request that only accepts JSON?  Get JSON back.  Accept HTML?  Get HTML back.
- **Javascript _optional_.**  If the client doesn't have Javascript enabled, applications built with Maki will continue to work using pure HTML.  When Javascript _is_ available, a performant and well-designed client-side application takes over to eliminate full-page loads.

## Instructions
You'll need [node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [mongodb](http://mongodb.org) to run this application.  Installing these is out-of-scope, and instructions are contained on the links to the left.

1. Clone the project (you can download the zip above or use git)
2. In the project's folder, run `npm install`.  Wait for it to install all necessary components.
3. Run `node maki.js`.

You'll now, by default, have a web application running at http://localhost:9200 -- you can edit the port by changing config.js.

## Directory Structure
Maki is meant to be understood without context or documentation, and as such the directory structure [and the code itself, for that matter] _should_ be fairly self-explanatory.  Nevertheless, here's an explicit declaration for each of the default folders and their intended use.
```bash
.
├── config         # configuration files (generally overridden by environment variables)
├── controllers    # application-specific logic
├── lib            # various classes / prototypes
├── models         # models (schemas, their validators, methods, and statics)
├── private        # resources not exposed to the client (LESS, etc.).  This is a 1:1 map of the public folder
│   └── css        # contains the LESS files used to generate the **public** CSS files (currently, autogenerated using asset-rack)
├── public         # resources exposed to the client (images, CSS, etc)
│   ├── css        # CSS
│   ├── fonts      # Fonts (.woff, etc.)
│   ├── img        # Images
│   └── js         # JavaScript
└── views          # composable elements for rendering HTML, JSON, or XML
    ├── forms      # <form> elements that hav
    ├── layouts    # layout rules that can be used to compose complete rendered items
    ├── mixins     # generator functions for view-related code
    └── partials   # composable elements to be included with a single view
```

## Spirit
Please feel free to submit changes to this repo via pull requests!  We're trying to keep this as general and flexible as possible, so anyone can take the project and run with it.
