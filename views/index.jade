      h4 Full-Javascript Stack
      p Build your app without wasting time on context switching.  Every layer of the Maki stack is Javascript, from the database (MongoDB) to the server (Node.js) and on to the clientside.

      h4 Authentication
      p We've built authentication into the stack (using PassportJS), including username and password auth, and OAuth using providers like Facebook and Twitter.  Spend your time on your app, not third-party auth.

      h4 UI
      p We're using Bootstrap for our base CSS framework, giving us a generally semantic way of building interface elements.  In addition, we're using Jade to simplify the construction of HTML using simple style rules.

      h5 Tooltips
      p Add <code>.tooltipped</code> to an element to enable automatic generation of a tooltip for that element, defaulting to its <code>title</code> attribute.
      p For example, 
        code
          | a.tooltipped(href="/about", title="Learn More about Maki") About
        |  will produce: 
        a.tooltipped(href="/about", title="Learn More about Maki") About
