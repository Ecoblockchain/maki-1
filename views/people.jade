        h1 People: the Maki Community
        p We are the people working towards <a href="https://slack-files.com/T09HF1HK9-F1827U79U-5cf8742c4f">the Maki Vision</a> by being members of <a href="https://chat.maki.io">the public chat</a>.  Add yourself to this list by <a href="https://chat.maki.io">signing in to Slack</a>, and update it by editing your profile there.
        p Conveniently, this page also serves as an example resource that can be synchronized with an oracle (or more simply, a trusted API).  Take a <a href="https://github.com/martindale/maki/blob/recognition/tools/slack.sync.people.js">look at the source code</a>!
